# Euler's Identity with Tau
A LaTeX document of [Euler's Identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_identity) (which ties together five of the most fundamental constants in mathematics), with Ï€ replaced by Ï„:

> e<sup>iÏ„</sup> = 1 + 0

where

> Ï„ â‰¡ 2Ï€

The traditional form of [Euler's Identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_identity) looks like so:

> e<sup>iÏ€</sup> + 1 = 0

The main reason why this is inelegant is that you need to rearrange [Euler's Formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_formula) to achieve this form like so:

> e<sup>iÎ¸</sup> = cos(Î¸) + isin(Î¸)

> e<sup>iÏ€</sup> = cos(Ï€) + isin(Ï€)

> e<sup>iÏ€</sup> = -1 + 0

> e<sup>iÏ€</sup> + 1 = 0

wheras, with Ï„, no rearrangement is needed:

> e<sup>iÏ„</sup> = cos(Ï„) + isin(Ï„)

> e<sup>iÏ„</sup> = 1 + 0

This was inspired by Michael Hartl's [Tau Manifesto](https://tauday.com/tau-manifesto). Basically, Ï„ is a more natural and elegant constant to describe circles and also happens to clean up many other math equations which use 2Ï€.

I made this so that I could make a high quality print and hang this equation up on my wall ğŸ¤“
